So I dont really honestly have a thing I am most interested in, I am definetly intrested in having the ability to create efficent databases and more complicated stuff then what was covered in earlier compsci classes. So I am intrested by the topic for sure, i am a little bit scared due to the legacy for this class but i understand that its probably the single most important class i will take at chapman for Data Analytics so i hope to sponge up as much as I can.
